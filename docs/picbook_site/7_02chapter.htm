      diodes</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">LEDs are surely one of the most commonly used 
      elements in electronics. LED is an abbreviation for 'Light Emitting 
      Diode'. When choosing a LED, several parameters should be looked at: 
      diameter, which is usually 3 or 5 mm (millimeters), working current which 
      is usually about 10mA (It can be as low as 2mA for LEDs with high 
      efficiency - high light output), and color of course, which can be red or 
      green though there are also orange, blue, yellow....<br/>LEDs must be 
      connected around the correct way, in order to emit light and the 
      current-limiting resistor must be the correct value so that the LED is not 
      damaged or  burn out (overheated). The positive of the supply is 
      taken to the anode, and the cathode goes to the negative or ground of the 
      project (circuit). In order to identify each lead, the cathode is the 
      shorter lead and the LED "bulb" usually has a cut or "flat" on the cathode 
      side. Diodes will emit light only if current is flowing from anode to 
      cathode. Otherwise, its PN junction is reverse biased and current won't 
      flow. In order to connect a LED correctly, a resistor must be added in 
      series that to limit the amount of current through the diode, so that it 
      does not burn out. The value of the resistor is determined by the amount 
      of current you want to flow through the LED. Maximum current flow trough 
      LED was defined by manufacturer.</font></p>

<td valign="top" width="362"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To determine the 
            value of the dropper-resistor, we need to know the value of the 
            supply voltage. From this we subtract the characteristic voltage 
            drop of a LED. This value will range from 1.2v to 1.6v depending on 
            the color of the LED. The answer is the value of <b>Ur.</b> Using 
            this value and the current we want to flow through the LED (0.002A 
            to 0.01A) we can work out the value of the resistor from the formula 
            <b>R=Ur/I</b>. </font> </td>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">LEDs are connected to a microcontroller in 
      two ways. One is to switch them on with logic zero, and other to switch 
      them on with logic one. The first is called NEGATIVE logic and the other 
      is called POSITIVE logic. The next diagram shows how to connect POSITIVE 
      logic. Since POSITIVE logic provides a voltage of +5V to the diode and 
      dropper resistor, it will emit light each time a pin of port B is provided 
      with a logic 1. The other way is to connect all anodes to +5V and to 
      deliver logical zero to cathodes.</font></p>
