<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oscillator circuit is used for providing a 
      microcontroller with a clock. Clock is needed so that microcontroller 
      could execute a program or program instructions.<br/><br/></font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Types of oscillators</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br/><br/>PIC16F84 can work with four different configurations of an 
      oscillator. Since configurations with crystal oscillator and 
      resistor-capacitor (RC) are the ones that are used most frequently, these 
      are the only ones we will mention here. Microcontroller type with a 
      crystal oscillator has in its designation XT, and a microcontroller with 
      resistor-capacitor pair has a designation RC. This is important because 
      you need to mention the type of oscillator when buying a 
      microcontroller. <br/><br/></font><font face="Verdana" size="4">XT

<td rowspan="4" width="277"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Crystal oscillator 
            is kept in metal housing with two pins where you have written down 
            the frequency at which crystal oscillates. One ceramic capacitor of 
            30pF whose other end is connected to the ground needs to be 
            connected with each pin.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oscillator and capacitors can be packed 
            in joint case with three pins. Such element is called ceramic 
            resonator and is represented in charts like the one below. Center 
            pins of the element is the ground, while end pins are connected with 
            OSC1 and OSC2 pins on the microcontroller. When designing a device, 
            the rule is to place an oscillator nearer a microcontroller, so as 
            to avoid any interference on lines on which microcontroller is 
            receiving a clock.</font></p></td>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">RC Oscillator</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2"><br/><br/>In applications where great time precision is not 
      necessary, RC oscillator offers additional savings during purchase. 
      Resonant frequency of RC oscillator depends on supply voltage rate, 
      resistance R, capacity C and working temperature. It should be mentioned 
      here that resonant frequency is also influenced by normal variations in 
      process parameters, by tolerance of external R and C components, 
      etc.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" height="194" src="2_02chapter_files/2_8.gif" width="487"/></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Above diagram shows how RC oscillator is 
      connected with PIC16F84. With value of resistor R being below 2.2k, 
      oscillator can become unstable, or it can even stop the oscillation. With 
      very high value of R (ex.1M) oscillator becomes very sensitive to noise 
      and humidity. It is recommended that value of resistor R should be between 
      3 and 100k. Even though oscillator will work without an external capacitor 
      (C=0pF), capacitor above 20pF should still be used for noise and 
      stability. No matter which oscillator is being used, in order to get a 
      clock that microcontroller works upon, a clock of the oscillator must be 
      divided by 4. Oscillator clock divided by 4 can also be obtained on 
      OSC2/CLKOUT pin, and can be used for testing or synchronizing other 
      logical circuits.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" height="133" src="2_02chapter_files/2_9.gif" width="512"/></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following a supply, oscillator starts 
      oscillating. Oscillation at first has an unstable period and amplitude, 
      but after some period of time it becomes stabilized.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" height="232" src="2_02chapter_files/2_10.gif" width="582"/></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To prevent such inaccurate clock from 
      influencing microcontroller's performance, we need to keep the 
      microcontroller in reset state during stabilization of oscillator's clock. 
      Diagram above shows a typical shape of a signal which microcontroller gets 
      from the quartz oscillator.</font></p>
